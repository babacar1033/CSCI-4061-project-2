- The purpose of your program: The purpose of our program is to implement the functions of the Map Reduce Algorithm that 
involve Inter-Process Communication. *FINISH* 

- How to compile the program: One can compile our program by first using the command "make" in a shell.

- What exactly your program does:

- Any assumptions outside this document:

- Contribution by each member of the team:
	-Contribution by Babacar Diouf: 
		-Wrote the shuffle() and getChunkData() functions.
		-Helped debug whole program.
	-Contribution by Shubhavi Arya: 
		-Wrote the parts of sendChunkData() function that does not involve string processing. 
		-Helped debug whole program.
	-Contribution by Rezkath Awal: 
		-Wrote the part of sendChunkData() function that does involve string processing. Wrote getInterData() function.  
		-Helped debug whole program.
		-Wrote this README file.
	

The README file does not have to be long, but must properly describe the above points. The code should
be well commented, it doesn’t mean each and every line. When a TA looks at your code he/she/they
should be able to understand the jist. You might want to focus on the “why” part, rather than the “how”,
when you add comments.
